# Concept Guide

## SPDX Documents

An **SPDX Document** is a file that contains SPDX-formatted information about a
collection of software.

The [SPDX specification](https://spdx.org/specifications) defines the fields and
formatting of SPDX Documents. Currently, there are two recognized data formats
for SPDX Documents: *RDF/XML* and a *custom tag-value* format. The SPDX project
is actively exploring adding more common data exchange formats, in particular
JSON and YAML.

The examples in this cookbook use the *tag-value* format, since it is more
human-readable and easier to understand. A brief introduction to the format is
included at the beginning of the use case examples chapter.
