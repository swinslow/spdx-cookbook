# Introduction

## SPDX

**SPDX** is the Software Package Data Exchange project. The goal of SPDX is to
create a set of data exchange standards that enable companies and organizations
to share human-readable and machine-processable software package metadata to
facilitate software supply chain processes.

SPDX is an open standard for the communication of **software bill of material**
information among individuals, organizations and tools.

SPDX is an open source project organized within The Linux Foundation. SPDX and
Software Package Data Exchange are registered trademarks of The Linux
Foundation.

## The SPDX Ecosystem

As a project and an ecosystem, SPDX primarily consists of:

* a **specification** for interchange of **software bill of materials**
  information via **SPDX Documents**;
* a **license list** to curate and provide stable, standardized identifiers and
  license texts for commonly-seen licenses;
* a **collection of tools** that assist with the production and use of SPDX
  Documents; and
* recommendations for ways to communicate relevant information, such as through
  use of SPDX **short-form license identifiers**.
